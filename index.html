            <p> My name is Ria Antony and I am a Master's of Information Management and Systems (MIMS) student at UC Berkeley. 
                I am pursuing a MIMS degree because I hope to pursue a career in UX Research. I am really passionate about entertainment 
                and finding ways to make experiences around it enjoyable (after all, entertainment is intended to be enjoyed). I'm 
                also really passionate about being a fan/fan culture. Being a part of a fan community has brought me a lot of joy through out my
                life so I care deeply about the space.

                In my free time, I like to listen to music and play video games. I also enjoy watching shows (anime, sitcoms, all sorts of stuff really),
                however, due to my nonexistent attention span I tend to only like shows with 20-25 minute episodes. My favoirte music genres are K-pop, early 2000s American pop,
                and osts of all sorts of stuff (mostly video games and animes). If I can dance to it and/or it makes me feel like a protagonist, I'll probably like the song.
                Lastly, in terms of video games, I only really play single-player games. I really enjoy adventure and rpg games. Some of my favorites are Persona 4 Golden and 
                Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (and Breath of the Wild too).
